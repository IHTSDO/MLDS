# Existing Affiliate Registers on site
An existing affiliate registers on the new site so they can gain access to the standards and satisfy their obligations under the licenses.

# New Affiliate Applies for license
An potential affiliate registers on the new site so they can gain access to the standards, and later satisfy their obligations under the licenses.

Both of these stories can be satisfied by the registration flow:

- An existing affiliate is informed of the obligation/opportunity to register on the new site, and follows a link to the home page.
- New applicants discover the registration page by some other means.
- The home page educates the user, and directs the user to create an account.
- The active user creates an account and confirms email receipt.
- The email confirmation transports the user to application page.
- The user selects their usage type (individual vs org, research vs commercial affiliate) and completes the application as guided.
- The user submits the application for review.
