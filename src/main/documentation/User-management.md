# Users

The system uses to repositories to manage users.  The first is a collection of local tables rooted at "t_user", and the second is the IHTSDO web authentication system (development default is https://usermanagement2.ihtsdotools.org/security-web/).  Affiliate users are created in the local database, while administrative users are normally sourced from the web authentication system.
