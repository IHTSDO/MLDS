Document Release Process
========================

To finish, you will need credentials for the ihtsdo-public-nexus server in your settings.xml.
The only account we have right now is for buckleym.
                <server>
                        <id>ihtsdo-public-nexus</id>
                        <username>buckleym</username>
                        <password>******</password>
                </server>

Steps:                
git pull master and develop

mvn jgitflow:release-start
mvn jgitflow:release-finish
-- wait to upload - takes a while


Once the Release is done to deploy to the ihtsdo-dev server or the ihtsdo-demo server:
ssh administrator@ihtsdo-dev
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade mlds


Back on local dev machine:
git push
